Motion Estimation
"encoder/analyse.c" is used to analyse the cost of the different predictions available. 
"encoder/me.c" is used for motion estimation.
"common/mvpred.c" is used to try to predict motion vectors (from neighbours etc.).

MOTION ESTIMATION (P-frames) is done by the following functions (using EPZS) for 16x16. All functions are always called no matter the chosen motion estimation method set by the optional input parameter:

	x264_mb_predict_mv_16x16( h, 0, i_ref, m.mvp );
		- Finds the median predictor

	x264_mb_predict_mv_ref16x16( h, 0, i_ref, mvc, &i_mvc );
		- Find additional candidates:
			- Spatial neighbours: left, top, top-left, and top-right
			- Temporal neighbours: co-located, right, bottom

	x264_me_search_ref( h, &m, mvc, i_mvc, p_halfpel_thresh );
		- Calculate best MV candidate from above (SAD) and use it as starting point for ME (defualt: 1-step diamond).
		- Also defined as "x264_me_search" in me.h

NOTE: No early stopping seems to be defined for the EPZS part.


For smaller prediction block sizes the following functions are used (e.g. 4x4):

	x264_mb_predict_mv( h, 0, idx, 1, m->mvp );
	x264_me_search( h, m, &a->l0.me8x8[i8x8].mv, i_mvc );

SAD: Sum of absolute differences
SATD: Sum of absolute transform differences (more complex than SAD)
